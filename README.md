## My process

I first built the website how I thought I should, with my knowledge I managed to build and style everything execpt for the responsive image. I first tried to use a div tag with a background image and a scrset however I couldn't get the sizing to be responsive. So I watched Kevin Powell's video on this challenge and learned how to use picture tag to make the responsive image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use picture element and how to make responsive images.

### Useful resources
